## ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2023

The ELIXIR AHM 2023 will be in Dublin and its not that easy to reach an Island by train :wink:.
An alternative to a flight is a ferry and with [Direct-Ferries](https://www.directferries.com) booking a boattrip to Dublin
is straight forward.
We recommend to travel from Cherbourg for all people nearby France and from Holyhead for our UK friends. Its also possible
to travel with the Eurostar express to the UK and then with the Ferry.
